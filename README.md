# Backend Stack With Vapor and SQLite

Vapor is web framework for Swift, in this project I used SQLite for database.

If you need ORM (Object Relational Mapping) SQL or noSQL, Vapor has Fluent.

I has deployed on [vapor-sqlite](https://vapor-sqlite.herokuapp.com)

Prequired:

Vapor Version 3.0

## Let's Try My Project

If you have already installed the Vapor toolbox, you can create a new Vapor project from this repo using the following command:

    vapor new YourProjectName --template=sanengineer/vapor-sqlite
